            <h3>Dataset properties</h3>
            <p>The total number of images: 90483.</p>
            <p>Training set size: 67692 images (one fruit or vegetable per image).</p>
            <p>Test set size: 22688 images (one fruit or vegetable per image).</p>
            <p>The number of classes: 131 (fruits and vegetables).</p>
            <p>Image size: 100x100 pixels.</p>
            <p>
              Filename format: image<em>index</em>100.jpg (e.g. 32<em>100.jpg) or r</em>image<em>index</em>100.jpg (e.g. r<em>32</em>100.jpg) or r2<em>image</em>index<em>100.jpg or r3</em>image<em>index</em>100.jpg. "r" stands for rotated
              fruit. "r2" means that the fruit was rotated around the 3rd axis. "100" comes from image size (100x100 pixels).
            </p>
            <p><strong>WARNING</strong></p>
            <p>
              There is a new -major version- of the dataset under release. A test archive (named fruits-360-original-size.zip) was already loaded to Kaggle. The new version contains images at their original (captured) size.<br />
              The name of the image files in the new version does not contain the "_100" suffix anymore. This will help you to make distinction between this version and the old 100x100 version.<br />
              So, if you use the 100x100 version, please make sure that the file names have the "_100" suffix. All others MUST be ignored.
            </p>
            <p><strong>END OF WARNING</strong></p>
            <p>Different varieties of the same fruit (apple for instance) are stored as belonging to different classes.</p>
            <h3>How fruits were filmed</h3>
            <p>Fruits and vegetables were planted in the shaft of a low-speed motor (3 rpm) and a short movie of 20 seconds was recorded.</p>
            <p>A Logitech C920 camera was used for filming the fruits. This is one of the best webcams available.</p>
            <p>Behind the fruits, we placed a white sheet of paper as a background.</p>
            <p>Here is a movie showing how the fruits and vegetables are filmed: <a rel="noreferrer nofollow" href="https://youtu.be/_HFKJ144JuU">https://youtu.be/_HFKJ144JuU</a></p>
            <h3>How fruits were extracted from background</h3>
            <p>
              However, due to the variations in the lighting conditions, the background was not uniform and we wrote a dedicated algorithm that extracts the fruit from the background. This algorithm is of flood fill type: we start from each
              edge of the image and we mark all pixels there, then we mark all pixels found in the neighborhood of the already marked pixels for which the distance between colors is less than a prescribed value. We repeat the previous step
              until no more pixels can be marked.
            </p>
            <p>All marked pixels are considered as being background (which is then filled with white) and the rest of the pixels are considered as belonging to the object.</p>
            <p>The maximum value for the distance between 2 neighbor pixels is a parameter of the algorithm and is set (by trial and error) for each movie.</p>
            <p>Pictures from the test-multiple_fruits folder were taken with a Nexus 5X phone.</p>
